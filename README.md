# Rainmeter
Desktop visualizers and other tools. These skins are currently configured for a triple-monitor or dual-monitor setup.

This setup includes:
(Left) 55-inch 4k TV
(Main monitor) 24-inch 1440p monitor
(Right) 24-inch 1080p monitor

All skins are only on the left TV and main monitor. Music visualization skins are on the TV and productivity skins are on the main monitor.

## Skins and Other Tools Used

### Music Visualization

#### Monstercat Visualizer

#### Fountain of Colors

#### Discombobulator 9000

#### Spicetify (DEPRECATED)
Spicetify has now been updated to use spicetify-cli. The command line interface is not a part of Rainmeter, but interfaces with Rainmeter skins and the Spotify API. All customizations available with the deprecated Rainmeter skin are still available from the command line. [Github repo with install instructions here.](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli/)

[Further instructions are available in this guide if you are having trouble setting up spicetify-cli.](https://www.ghacks.net/2019/10/25/how-to-customize-spotify-with-spicetify-cli-themes/)

Use Powershell to run the Spicetify command line interface. If Spotify updates (you are no longer able to see song information), run `spicetify backup apply` in Powershell.


### Productivity

#### Elegance 2

#### Genteel

#### UnFold
